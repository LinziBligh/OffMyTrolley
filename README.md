# OffMyTrolley


Welcome OffMyTrolley! This SPA app allows people to post details of an upcoming grocery delivery and allows other people to utilize any additional space left in their delivery, if they are unable to get a delivery slot of their own. Developed during the Covid-19 lockdown as a way of maximising efficiency of Supermarket delivery slots whilst enabling neighbours that need it most to be able to get essential groceries without leaving their homes(other than to the neighbours house to pick it up).

Installation Run this line first:

bundle install
